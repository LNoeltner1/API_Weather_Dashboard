## WEATHER DASHBOARD

The aim of this project was to create a weather forecasting page using OpenWeatherMap's current weather, five day forecast, and UV Index API's. I learned a lot more about Javascript while making this website and heavily reinforced my knowledge of Bootstrap and moment.js. When the user enters a city name input into the search bar and clicks the search icon, the current weather conditions of that city (temperature, humidity, wind speed and the UV index) and the current time and date will populate the page and the user will see a five-day forecast (with temperature and humidity) for the selected city at the bottom-right.

## Issues

1. The API URL's/Keys work perfectly fine on my computer, but GitHub Pages blocks the URLs, as it says they are unsecured (they are all written "https://...").
